# Basic Website

This website is made for buying and selling Blizzard products. I have used PHP Laravel and Blade in the MVC model to make it. I have used Controller to do the logical process, PHPMyAdmin for Database, .blade file for view, and Laravel authenticator for checking the user's login details.
